knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Description

This dataset consists of script from all Lord of the Rings Trilogy - Fellowship of the Rings, Two Towers and Return of the King. This dataset has 2390 observations for 4 variables. It was collected from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data>. The dataset decribes the script for each character and which movie it is from. The dataset is a delimited flat file while the delimiter is a space

## Loading Packages

```{r load-packages, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

    library(tidyverse)  
    library(dplyr)  
    library(knitr)  
    library(bslib)  
    library(readr)
    library(stringr)
    library(DT)

```

## Reading the data with read.csv function from the package readr

```{r read, echo=TRUE}

        lotr <- read.csv("C:/Users/rashm/Desktop/ANA 515 Fundamentals of Data Storage/LOTR/lotr_scripts.csv")

```

## Cleaning/Pre-Processing Data

```{r clean, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE, results='hide'}

    lotr_df <- lotr %>%
        rename(character_name = char) #Renaming the column char to character_name 
        str_to_title(lotr_df$character_name) #Converting the character names to title case
        trimws(lotr_df$dialog) #I have noticed some of the dialogues have a leading white space. So, we're trimming it


        ## I have hidden the output for this code chunk as it produces a large amount of data. Below is another chunk of code with data table to format it 
        
        
```

```{r output, echo=TRUE}

        datatable(lotr_df, rownames=TRUE, filter="top", options=list(pageLength=6, scrollX=T)) #This is reduce the number of rows shown in the output


```

## Characteristics of Data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
        
        observations <- nrow(lotr_df)
        variables <- ncol(lotr_df)

```

This data frame has `r observations` rows and `r variables` columns. The names of the columns and a brief description of each are in the table below:

## Table

```{r, echo=TRUE}

        kable(str(lotr_df))


```

## Summary Statistics

```{r, echo=TRUE}

#Since my data set only has one variable with numeric values, I chose to apply the required functions to it


    FrodoFilter <- filter(lotr_df, character_name=="FRODO")
    FrodoMin <- min(FrodoFilter$X)
    FrodoMax <- max(FrodoFilter$X)
    FrodoMean <- mean(FrodoFilter$X)
    FrodoMV <- colSums(is.na(FrodoFilter))
    summary(FrodoFilter) #Using summary function

```

## Saving summary stats

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}

    FrodoSummary <- data.frame(FrodoMin, FrodoMax, FrodoMean, FrodoMV)
    print(FrodoSummary)

```
